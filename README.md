## Project Overview
"Video Games and the Male Gaze" is a project that explores gender representation in video games using data analysis and visualization. The project comprises two Jupyter notebooks, a Dash web application, and a presentation that delves into the theoretical aspects of the subject matter.

## Project Structure
### 1. Jupyter Notebooks
**Notebook 1: How often is the male gaze present in video games?**

Purpose: Analyze the frequency and presence of the male gaze in video games.

Contents:
Importing libraries (pandas, plotly express, etc),
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps,
Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA),
Analyzing metadata for indications of the male gaze,
Visualizing the presence of the male gaze in various video games,

Output: Cleaned dataset and visualizations depicting the male gaze frequency

**Notebook 2: How much gender disparity is present in the video games community?**

Purpose: Investigate the extent of gender disparity within the video game community.

Contents:
Importing dataset and cleaning data,
Advanced data analysis using pandas,
Analyzing gender representation among game characters and developers,
Creating visualizations and interpreting the findings to highlight gender disparities,

Output: Charts and graphs representing gender disparity insights

### 2. Dash Web Application

Purpose: Provide an interactive platform for users to explore the data and visualizations.

Features:
Interactive charts and graphs

### 3. Theoretical Presentation

Purpose: Discuss the theoretical framework of the project, focusing on the concept of the male gaze and its impact on gender representation in video games.

Contents:
Introduction,
Overview of Video Games,
The Male Gaze,
Effect on Female Gamers and the Gaming Community,
Tropes vs Women,
Analysis of Findings From the Data,
Conclusions
